# YouTube Sift - A Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that allows users to filter out YouTube videos based on keywords. It filters videos both by title and channel name.

The code is mostly generated interacting with ChatGPT.

## How it works

After adding the extension to your browser, click on its icon and you'll see a text area. Enter the keywords that you want to filter out, each on a new line, then click "Save". The changes will take effect when you reload the page or scroll down to load new videos.

1. Download or clone this repository to your machine.
2. In Google Chrome, go to "Extensions."
3. Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner.
