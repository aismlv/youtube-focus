# YouTube Sift - A Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that allows users to filter out videos on the YouTube homepage based on keywords. It filters videos both by title and channel name.

The code is mostly written in interaction with ChatGPT, so please use it with caution and contribute improvements and suggestions. The icon is generated by Bing Chat using DALLâˆ™E.

## How it works

After adding the extension to your browser, click on its icon and select either Title blocklist or Channel blocklist from the dropdown menu. Enter the keywords that you want to filter out, each on a new line, then click "Save". The changes will take effect when you reload the page or scroll down to load new videos.

The blocked videos are logged in the console, so you can see what videos are being filtered out.
